### Added

- Support for bootstrap steps in distributed builds

## 1.3.4 - 2025-08-14

### Fixed

- Fixed distributed BuildGraph Setup builds not respecting agent requirements from the original build, which could cause
  failures when Setup builds ran on incompatible agents [TW-95143](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/TW-95143)

## 1.3.3 - 2025-07-31

### Fixed

- Fixed BuildGraph setup builds being skipped when duplicate build names occur within the same project [TW-94428](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/TW-94428)
- Fixed a rare race condition during distributed BG setup where newly created dependencies weren't immediately
  visible to the TeamCity background build update process, causing the composite build to finish too early
  [TW-94598](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/TW-94598)

## 1.3.2 - 2025-05-26

### Fixed

- Distributed BuildGraph builds with badge state tracking enabled might not have worked as expected.

## 1.3.1 - 2025-05-08

### Fixed

- Fixed inconsistent handling of absolute paths in parameters across different runners [TW-91846](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/TW-91846)
- Fixed BuildGraph option parsing when values contained the `=` character [TW-93125](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/TW-93125)

## 1.3.0 - 2025-04-25

### Added

- Improved artifact visibility for BuildGraph-generated virtual builds in distributed mode [TW-90157](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/TW-90157)
- Support for UGS Metadata Server V2 (Horde) [TW-92748](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/TW-92748)

### Fixed

- Resolved an issue where the "main" BuildGraph build in distributed mode was incorrectly marked as "Failed to Start" [TW-91456](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/TW-91456)

## 1.2.0 - 2024-12-18

### Added

- Support for launching commandlets via the runner [TW-87818](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/TW-87818)
- Support for launching custom automation commands via the runner [TW-90747](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/TW-90747)
- Structured build logging and error highlighting
  [TW-88848](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/TW-88848).
  This means that previously successful builds might now generate build problems if any of the underlying Epic tools
  report them as errors.
  You can [mute][teamcity.build-problems.mute] these build problems or completely disable this new behavior
  by setting the `UE_LOG_JSON_TO_STDOUT` environment variable to "0" in your build configurations.
  That said, if you choose to do either of these, we encourage you to share your case with us by reporting a ticket.

[TW-87894](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/TW-87894)
